======================
1. Use model to enter HTML view fields for table
2. Use model to enter HTML form fields for add modal
3. Use model to enter HTML form fields for edit modal
4. Use model to enter JS properties for class
5. Use model to enter JS function to handle rendering table
6. Use model to enter JS function to handle rendering add modal
7. Use model to enter JS function handle rendering edit modal

==================================================================

User
    - Fix date formatting on table
    - change undefined values on table to just show empty string

User is now added to the system
Next step is to provide a set list of selectable roles (admin, member)
Selectable list of themes (light, dark)
Add date picker for date field
Change name to username

Ok, then users are added.
Keep member number disabled. This should be created from the member form
For members, update form for data validity

Add form validation last

Just allow admins to add users, add members. Then validate that members can log in
    - this will be later using passport

Finish setting up certificates with information from form

Finish setting up courses
Create courses form and validation
Create a selectable list using the values from certificates

Then finally, create sessions from courses

Finally, create contractor records and assign dispatches (with date ranges) to themes

Once all admin forms are created and validated, validate member views.

For now, just show a view of all upcoming scheduled training sessions
